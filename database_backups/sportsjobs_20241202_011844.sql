1	How to start your sports analytics career?	# What's the best way to get a job in sports analytics?\n\nLanding a job in sports analytics is not easy because it's a very niche group of potential employers and because it's a dream job. However, there are ways to increase your odds by A LOT.  \nYou must know that most people dream of getting a job in sports but really few actually work towards that. That's your edge.\n\n**The best tips to get a job in sports analytics:**\n\n### 1 - Do something that you can show\nIf you don't know anyone in the sports world, your best tool is to create something by yourself to show that you CAN do the job and that you are worth having an interview. Lots of options depending on what you feel more confident.\n- Get some data and analyze it, create a model predicting who will win, get some insights that you find interesting/curious. Someone else will think the same way.\n- If you are more into BI create a good dashboard, or a nice visualization as shown in a previous newsletter.\n- If you are more technical, you can reproduce a paper or blog from someone else, even better if you tweak it or for a different use case (That's what I did for my master's degree!)\n- If you are more into backend, you can create an API for data, or ETL for data engineering.\n- ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO! JUST DO IT AND SHOW IT.\nBy show it, I mean, put it on your resume, share it in LinkedIn, share it Twitter. Social media is your friend. And be ready to talk about it if someone gets interested.\n\n### 2 - Actively look for jobs\nIt's easy to say there aren't many opportunities, all of them receive hundreds of resumes and any other excuse you might think. Although those arguments are essentially true, you can find workarounds. As in any of these jobs, if you are not always looking for solutions, you will have a hard time.\nA few ideas:\n- Don't expect to get advertised about the jobs. If you are not doing anything and you expect them to appear, you will get few opportunities and with plenty of competition. As you got alerted, everyone else too.\n- Look for them. How? Well, obviously [www.sportsjobs.online](www.sportsjobs.online) but any other resource is also good. Go to LinkedIn, google, get another board, check directly in some organizations you like, etc. Most people don't do this. You should. Bookmark a few and regularly do a search.\n- Increase your network. X (Twitter) has a lot of people in sports analytics, usually not influencer, just low profile guys doing the job. Add one, then check who they follow, follow the lead. That people will post when a position is open and I guarantee you they receive much less resumes that you would expect. \n- Bonus: engage with them! Ask them tips, ask them any resource they use, ask them if they know about any position open, etc.\n- Don't focus only in your dream job. Chances are that you are not going to be the data guy in your favorite home team. But there are plenty of teams or organizations working with sports data. Aim for ANY job that resonates to you. Then you can jump but the first one is the most important.\n- Sports analytics is not only for a team! There are plenty of consultancy companies ([Zelus ](https://zelusanalytics.com/)is top notch, I shared the podcast of Daniel Lee last week). Maybe Zelus is hard to get into but follow them, see what they do, and look for other like them.\n- The betting world also exists! Maybe it's not your first thought but betting is highly increasing and they do need sports analytics. They need to put the odds, update them, do analytics on the different bets they allow, etc etc. Also you can create a model yourself. Be creative! Plenty of places to use your knowledge.\n\n### 3 - Engage\nIncrease your network. Talk to people, go to conferences if you can, join online spaces, discords, LinkedIn groups, follow people on X (Twitter) etc. It's hard work but once yo find a cool group and see other people doing what YOU want to do you will get motivated. Also you will learn a lot and people will start to know you.\nIt's an industry where getting into is not super easy but if you show the will and you show people you really want it and you can help them, then you will get in. If you do some work your odds increase by a lot and I mean it.\n\nI'm rooting for you. Once you see that someone answers you on Twitter, that someone likes some content you created, you will get more motivated and the wheel will start turning.\n\nKeep checking the newsletter. I will provide resources to help you! Such as people to follow, websites with material, companies to keep an eye on, etc.\nGood luck!\n	\N	Landing a job in sports analytics is not easy because it's a very niche group of potential employers and because it's a dream job.

11	About NFL analysis on the new OT rules. - Newsletter 11	The Superbowl keeps giving and giving.  This time I bring you an explanation around the overtime rules that were applied in the last few years.  \nBriefly, if you don’t follow the NFL, before the changes, when a match in the playoffs ended in a tie after all the regulation time, the teams played overtime to determine who wins and goes to the next stage (or win the trophy if it was the SuperBowl).  \nThe striking detail was that the team that scored the first point in any way (touchdown, fieldgoal, etc) would automatically win. The other team had no opportunity to tie the game again.  \nWhat happened? The random process (actually flipping a coin..) to determine who has the first attempt to score was crucial. The first team had a great advantage since if it went close enough to score a field goal it had a high chance of scoring, leaving the other team empty handed without even attacking.  \n\nRecently this changed:\n_Overtime rules in the postseason consist of as many 15-minute periods as are necessary until there is a winner, instead of the single 10-minute overtime period in the regular season. Both teams will now get at least one possession, even if the team that has the first possession scores a touchdown. If the team that got the ball first doesn't score a touchdown, or if the score is tied after each team has possessed the ball, the next score would end the game._\n\n\nI bring you a [simulation study from Michael Lopez](https://twitter.com/StatsbyLopez/status/1757991779968659930) analyzing the impact of the changes and how odds shift from one approach to the other.\nIt’s a good example of how you can share an analysis via Twitter/X , some good visualizations and clear explanations.

16	About RAPM in the NBA - Newsletter 14	# **RAPM in the NBA**\n\n## **Create your own RAPM analysis.**\n\n### **Do you know what RAPM means?**\nIt’s regularized adjusted plus minus. You might have heard of Plus Minus metric (+/-) in the NBA. It’s a summary stat that should address the impact of each player during a game. Positive is good, negative is bad. It depends on the performance of the team while the player was on court.\n\nIt seems good, and it is, but has a lot of flaws. Specially when you factor in that some player play much more than others, and in particular, with different teammates.\n\nEach team is different, and inside each team, the rotation is different. If you score a lot during garbage time, against the worst roster of your opponent… plus minus doesn’t know that.\n\nRAPM comes to fix that, or try. In summary, it takes into account who is on the court at the same time, both teammates and opponents. So, if you always play along Lebron James maybe you are not the one having the greatest impact on the court..\n\nIt’s super interesting and a good exercise to do if you want to add something to your portfolio and bag of tricks.\n\nI’ve found this site that has a[ nice dataset to do it yourself](https://data.scorenetwork.org/basketball/nba-rapm-data.html?utm_source=sportsjobs.online) (and more data even for other sports!).\n\nIf you want a more in depth explanation on how to do this, you can follow this [series of posts.](https://squared2020.com/2017/09/18/deep-dive-on-regularized-adjusted-plus-minus-i-introductory-example/) The author worked for several teams in the NBA, just scroll around to find the rest of the parts!\n\n	\N	Do you know what RAPM means? t’s regularized adjusted plus minus.

17	About the Use of Betting Markets in Sports Analytics - Newsletter 17	# **Exploring the Use of Betting Markets in Sports Analytics**\nSports analytics continues to evolve, and a recent project at Carnegie Mellon University highlights its significant impact. Researchers have revisited Glickman and Stern’s state-space model, adapting it to NFL data with Bayesian statistics through the STAN platform in R. This update not only refreshes the model but also shows how these analytical techniques can be applied across different sports.\n## **Understanding the Approach**\nOriginally used for NHL data, this [state-space model ](https://statsbylopez.netlify.app/post/a-state-space-model-to-evaluate-sports-teams/?utm_source=sportsjobs.online)is crafted to assess team strength throughout the season. Unlike traditional metrics that focus on outcomes like wins, losses, or point differentials, this model uses betting market numbers to provide a dynamic estimate of team strength.\n### **Why Focus on Betting Market Data?**\nThe reasoning is clear yet insightful: betting markets often reflect a team's potential more accurately than the results of games themselves. Before any game starts, betting odds offer a condensed insight into a team’s capabilities, shaped by financial stakes and market expertise. This view supports the growing recognition in sports analytics that betting market data, despite its challenges, often predicts outcomes more reliably than other metrics.\n## **Practical Applications for Aspiring Analysts**\nFor those entering the field of sports analytics or looking to enhance their skills, this model is a valuable resource. Using such models can broaden your analytical skills and significantly enrich your portfolio. Whether you're starting and trying to understand the basic concepts or an experienced analyst ready to tackle the detailed techniques, the methodology demonstrated in Carnegie Mellon’s recent study serves as a practical example of applying sophisticated statistical methods in real-world settings.\n### **A Step Toward Professional Growth**\nEngaging with this kind of analysis can distinguish you in the competitive field of sports analytics. It shows a commitment to solving complex problems and using advanced tools that go beyond simple solutions. Moreover, for those seeking job opportunities in this field, understanding and discussing these methodologies can be a strong talking point in interviews and networking situations.\n## **How Can This Benefit You?**\nIf you're looking to start a career in sports analytics or carve out a niche within this industry, getting familiar with the tools and techniques used in advanced models like this can be extremely beneficial. You can use insights from betting markets to inform your analyses, providing a solid foundation for making predictions or evaluating team and player performances.\n### **Let's Continue the Conversation**\nIf you're interested in the possibilities of Bayesian statistics in sports or have any questions about implementing these techniques, feel free to reach out. Our goal is to build a community where aspiring analysts can grow and succeed. Whether through detailed blog posts, interactive webinars, or one-on-one discussions, we’re here to help you navigate the intricacies of this dynamic field.\nVisit our job board for more insights and opportunities in sports analytics, and let us help you turn your passion for sports into a successful career.\n	\N	Researchers have revisited Glickman and Stern’s state-space model, adapting it to NFL data with Bayesian statistics through the STAN platform in R.

18	About Kristaps Porzingis - Newsletter 18	# **Kristaps Porziņģis: A Story of Transformation Through Analytics**\nKristaps Porziņģis, once scrutinized for his less efficient post-up plays with the Dallas Mavericks, has remarkably transformed his game and career trajectory by embracing the power of analytics.\n## **Embracing Data for Game Improvement**\nInitially viewed as inefficient in certain areas of his gameplay, Porziņģis took a deep dive into analytics, turning statistical insights into his strongest allies. His journey is a compelling example of how data can redefine an athlete’s career. At 7-foot-2, he was struggling with post-ups but has now delivered one of the most efficient seasons in NBA history for that play type.\n### **The Transformation**\nPorziņģis underwent a rigorous analysis of his performance, using his height and skills more effectively around the basket to boost his efficiency. He refined his game, choosing to focus on moves and positions that data showed were most effective for him. This wasn’t just a minor adjustment but a drastic reduction, stripping away about 50% of his previous game strategies.\n## **Collaboration and Comprehensive Changes**\nThe big man didn’t undertake this transformation alone; he collaborated with a close friend and basketball analytics expert Dean Oliver. This partnership led to substantial changes in his playing style. Porziņģis reduced his dribbles before shooting, focused on historically efficient shooting spots, and even tailored his physical training to enhance his agility rather than just bulk. These changes marked a complete overhaul of his approach, driven by the clear, objective insights offered by analytics.\n## **The Impact of Data-Driven Decisions**\nPorziņģis' evolution is a powerful testament to the potential of data in sports. It highlights that embracing analytics can lead to significant improvements, not only in individual skills but also in an athlete’s overall mindset. As he prepares for new challenges in the playoffs with the Boston Celtics, his transition from being perceived as a liability in post-ups to becoming a dominant player is incredibly inspiring.\n### **Beyond Overcoming Challenges**\nHis story is more than just about overcoming inefficiencies; it is a clear demonstration of the transformative impact of sports analytics. It shows that with the right data and a readiness to adapt, athletes can explore limitless possibilities and redefine their paths.\nAs Porziņģis continues to excel, his journey serves as an inspiration for athletes and analysts alike, proving the transformative power of data in sports. This is not just about refining existing skills—it's about revolutionizing how athletes approach, evaluate, and enhance their performances for groundbreaking results.\n	\N	Kristaps Porziņģis, once scrutinized for his less efficient post-up plays with the Dallas Mavericks, has remarkably transformed his game and career trajectory by embracing the power of analytics.	2024-04-30 15:19:35+00	\N	2024-04-30

Sports fans would travel to stadiums/arenas to participate in the live experience or carved out a few hours to sit down in their living room (or the local pub) to tune into the game. While the internet and mobile devices have made it easier to consume sports from anywhere, technology has, for many years, limited innovation around new ways to engage with sports.   \n\n\nToday, computers have caught up with our imagination driving shifts in consumer behavior that are redefining the way fans enjoy sports almost overnight.

Placing a bet a second too late matters.  Watching a highlight after all your friends have told you about it matters.
